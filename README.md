This will become an app for playing the card game Oh Hell (subsequently referred to as "Oh H*ck" since I don't want to expose malleable, innocent minds to words like hell and heck/h*ck) with other people on your LAN. 

# Timeline
I'm making this because I'm on winter break and there's not much to do back home. So there's not really a fixed schedule for this. In some amount of time there should be a playable desktop client. Some amount of time after that there should be an Android client. If I get REALLY bored before the spring semester starts, there may even be an iOS client.
